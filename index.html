        <h4>FR!ZZ's GAME RULES:</h4>
        <p> 1. This game has two players, playing in rounds.</p>
        <p>2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he wishes. Each result gets added to his "Round"(the
            white boxes with curved edges)
            score.</p>
        <p>3. BUT, if the player rolls a one (1), all his "Round" score gets lost. After that, it's the second player
            turn.</p>
        <p>4. The player can choose to "HOLD", by pressing the hold button so as to save the numbers previously rolled
            in his round to his GLOBAL SCORE(which is the score underneath the player name) which means that his "Round"
            score gets added to his GLOBAL score. After
            that, it's the next player turn.</p>
        <p>5. The first player to reach 100points wins the game.</p>
        <p>6. Whenever you roll dice(6) on on a row twice, you lose your GLOBAL score

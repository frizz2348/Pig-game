        <h4>FR!ZZ's GAME RULES:</h4>

<p> This game has two boxes, one named the ROUND-SCORE(The white box) while the other is named GLOBAL-SCORE(The black box with red borders.).
The round score is where the dice or numbers you roll goes into while the Global-Score is where the saved "Round-scores" goes into.
 </p>
 <h3> The ROLL button is the button for rolling a dice.</h3>
 <h3> The HOLD button is the button for adding your Round-scores to your Global-Score. Note: Whenever you use this, you lose your turn and it's the next player's turn to roll dice.</h3>
<h3> The NEW GAME button is used to reset the game and start a new one.</h3>

        <p>Fill the input below to choose the total score you would prefer a winner to be declared.</p>
        <p> 1. This game has two players, playing in rounds.</p>
        <p>2. In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he/she wishes. Each result gets added to his/her "Round-Score".</p>
        <p>3. BUT, if the player rolls a one(1), you lose your "Round-score", and after that, it's the second player's
            turn.</p>
        <p>4. But you can choose to "HOLD", by pressing the hold button so as to save the numbers previously rolled
            in your round to your GLOBAL SCORE.</p>
        <p> To know who's the active player, the active player name is written in red with a dark background.</p>
